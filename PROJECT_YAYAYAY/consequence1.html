            <u><h2>Consequence of being Overweight/Obese</h2></u>
            <p>
                There are many negative consequences to being overweight or obese. These problems can actually start when someone is only 
                slightly overweight. The consequences that come with being severely overweight or obese are that there is an increase risk 
                for developing heart disease. You have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes and will also develop joint problems 
                due to the excess weight that is applied to your joints. There is also a increased risk of cancer when you are severely 
                overweight. These problems have a higher risk of developing the more weight you put on. So if you are only slightly 
                overweight you at a lower risk of developing these dieases than if you were mormidly obese.<br><br>
                
                More negative consequences to being overweight or obese include high blood pressure and high choleseterol. These are both 
                factors that contribute to the development of heart disease. More consequences can include trouble breathing which can lead to 
                sleep apnea, which is a disease that makes you stop breathing for a certain period of time when you sleep. Being severely 
                overweight can also lead to a decline in your mental health, you can develop depression, anxiety disorders and also have lower 
                self esteeem. You can also prevent all of these things from happening to you if you were to lose weight and get down to a healthier 
                weight. These problems have a lower chance of happening the closer you are to a healthy weight for you.
