            <u><h2>Consequences of being Overweight/Obese</h2></u>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    An increased risk for developing heart disease.<br><br>
                    When you are severely overweight, your cholesterol levels and your blood pressure are increased which 
                    both contribute to a higher risk for heart disease.<br><br>

                </li><br>
                <li>
                    You have a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes and will also develop joint problems.
                    <br><br>
                    Joint problems will develop as a result of being overweight because there is excess stress that is 
                    put onto them. Higher risk of developing Type 2 Diabetes when ur overweight is caused by excess belly 
                    fat which causes insulin to not be as effective which can lead to increased blood sugar levels.<br><br>

                </li><br>
                <li>
                    There is also a increased risk of cancer when you are severely overweight.<br><br>
                    When you are overweight, your hormone levels are going to be disrupted due to the 
                    constant inflammation caused by excess fat in your body. Hormones are what control 
                    cell division and if your homrone levels are disrupted then your body can signal to 
                    your cells to divide rapidly and cause the formation of a cancerous tumor in your body.<br><br>

                </li><br>
                <li>
                    You will develop sleep apnea<br><br>
                    Sleep apnea is a disease in which a persons airway is restricted when they are sleeping, this 
                    restriction can lead to a person not breathing for a few moments. This has a higher risk of 
                    happening in overweight people as the extra fat in their necks can block their airways for a 
                    couple seconds when they sleep<br><br>

                </li><br>
                <li>
                    Being overweight can lead to a decline in your mental health, you can develop depression, anxiety disorders and also have lower 
                    self esteeem.<br><br>

                    These are all terrible things that can happen to you if you are overweight, however if you were to 
                    lose weight and live a healthier lifestyle then your chance of these things happening to you are very 
                    low.<br><br>
